Personal notes about computer science, maths, and machine learning. Sometimes about physics and other random things. Very incomplete as of right now; but I'm not sure what 'complete' notes would look like either. It's also perhaps a little messy. Maybe a lot. I warned.

Since these are personal notes, don't expect very verbose explanations for things that might appear cryptic on the surface. Nor expect it to be perfectly accurate. In fact, if there are inaccuracies, I'd appreciate if you'd point it out to [me](mailto:me@ekunzanu.foo).
