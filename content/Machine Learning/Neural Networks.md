Neural networks are a way to model data using a combination of [affine](Mathematics/Linear%20Algebra.md#Affine%20Transformation) and non-linear transformations.

## Regression & Classification

* **Regression** — Predicting values from given input values. Returns continuous values. If more than one value is returned, it is called **multivariate regression**.
* **Classification** — Predicting a category. Returns discrete categories. If prediction is *from* one of two categories, it is called **binary classification**. If prediction is *from* more than two categories, it is called **multi-class classification**.

## Network Structure

Research suggests that [generalization](https://pair.withgoogle.com/explorables/grokking) is associated with well-structured representations. Different types of network structures exist depending on the type of problem. For example [CNNs](Machine%20Learning/Convolutional%20Neural%20Networks.md) use a specific neural network structure to process images.
