* **Artificial intelligence** — Systems with 'intelligent' behavior. Could be based on logic, probabilistic reasoning, etc.
* **Machine learning** — Subset of AI that makes decisions based on mathematical models.
* **Deep learning** — Subset of machine learning, using deep [neural networks](Machine%20Learning/Neural%20Networks.md).

Machine Learning can be divided into three sections:

* **Supervised learning** — There is input data and corresponding output data. Goal is to find features (patterns) to create predictions for unseen examples. Includes [general neural networks](Machine%20Learning/Neural%20Networks.md), [CNNs](Machine%20Learning/Convolutional%20Neural%20Networks.md), [Transformers](Machine%20Learning/Transformers.md), [GNNs](Machine%20Learning/Graph%20Neural%20Networks.md), etc.
* **Unsupervised learning** — There is input data but no corresponding output data or labels. Goals are diverse, ranging from generating new samples, revealing internal structures of datasets, etc. Includes [GANs](Machine%20Learning/Generative%20Adversarial%20Networks.md), [Variational Autoencoders](Machine%20Learning/Variational%20Autoencoders.md), [Diffusion Models](Machine%20Learning/Diffusion%20Models.md), etc.
* **Reinforcement learning** — *Agents* learn to perform *actions* in an *environment* with the goal of maximizing *rewards* in a non-deterministic way. Can be achieved using [Markov Processes](Machine%20Learning/Markov%20Processes.md).
